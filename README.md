# Boa.Py
An efficient and easy to use Python module for parsing web communications. Presumably can work with any modern markup language.

##What Does This Module Do *Now*?
Currently, you send it a string of http response data and a specific html tag. It will return an array containing the important data, along with information on how the data is structured/nested.

##Plans

1. Plan on rewriting it in C or C++
Basically writing in Python because of it's readability, I think it's great for concept/early stages of development.
  * Will still build a python module
  * Wish to build libraries for other languages like Java/.NET
2. Build a graphical tool for analysing a site for planning application development that communicate with it
  * This app will send varying requests and read the responses for change
  * This would be good for constructing scrapers, APIs, and possibly security
3. Later I wish to make it very dynamic and utilize pattern-finding and association.
  * Since machine learning can be a bit complex, possibly a sister module.
4. Make documentation.
